            Hey welcome to my page. My name is Jose and Im new to coding and still learning.
            There's not much gonng on here but we're working to fill it in as we go! 
            Right now just got a few things im working on but take a look around!
            <p>Few things right away, "Not much here...."I know, im new to this still but ill be filling in more as we move forward with the class, 
                but I come from a background in photography and a little but of graphic design. I wasn't able to graduate school because i had big family event come up, but i still miss it.
                In order to keep my skills up to date im been doing little photography here and there to keep up with things but i wanted to get into design and 
                Ive been told that i should look into UX design if im still interested in it. Its good to have the building blocks of how a website works so im here for the journey.
                <p> After I had helped my parents move to Las Vegas, i didn't have a clue as to what i wanted to do so i moved down to Indianapolis with some 
                    friends and ive been down here ever since.Ive worked with dogs for almost 10 years before i went off and stared a company
                    called Project A. We were a small marketing company that stared in early 2021. I handled the design part of things with a few employees then covid hit and no one really wanted to hire outside marketing 
                    so we went under but i learned a lot of how building relationships. I joined amazon just thinking that it would be a job but i love what do here for this company. 
                    Im a learning trainer at the "Q" and ive been doing this for almost 2 and half years. Been with amazon for almost 3. Glad I looked into career choice.
                </p>
                <p>Few things about me are that i love photography, not a big sweets person(had braces for 5 years and my mom wouldn't let me eat sweets)but i love me some cheesecake.
                    Im more of a Landscape photographer (the art of capturing pictures of nature and the outdoors in a way that brings your viewer into the scene) so I love being outside. Kinda goes hand and hand. 
                    Im hoping that this might take me to new locations. If your interest in getting a hold of me drop your email! Other then that....
